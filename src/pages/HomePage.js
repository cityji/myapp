            <p>
                Welcome to Studytonight! <br />
                I'm Nikhil Tiwari, a final year undergrad student at APSU. I created this blog site to share my knowledge and passion for programming with others. I'm particularly interested in React, and I hope to use this blog to teach others how to build amazing user interfaces with this powerful library.
            </p>
            <p>On this blog, you'll find tutorials, articles, and code examples on a variety of React topics. I'll also be sharing my thoughts on the latest React news and trends. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced React developer, I hope you'll find something useful on this blog.</p>
